Coding agents are moving beyond autocomplete and chat. The interesting action now sits at the intersection of repository context, tool use, verification loops, issue-to-PR workflows, and deployment controls.

This repository tracks that shift with a systems-first lens.

## Why This List Is Different

- It is organized around workflow, evaluation, and system design rather than vendor hype.
- It separates benchmark evidence from product claims and official engineering notes.
- It focuses on repository-scale and workflow-native coding agents, not generic code generation.

## Surveys and Roadmaps

Foundational overviews for understanding the coding-agent landscape at a high level.

- [AI Agentic Programming: A Survey of Techniques, Challenges, and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11126)
  A broad survey of agentic programming patterns, useful for framing planning, tools, memory, and evaluation as reusable components.
- [A Comprehensive Survey on Benchmarks and Solutions in Software Engineering of LLM-Empowered Agentic System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09721)
  A benchmark-heavy map of the emerging software-engineering agent landscape, especially useful as a coverage reference.
- [Agentic Software Engineering: Foundational Pillars and a Research Roadmap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06216)
  A roadmap-style view that helps connect coding agents to larger questions of trust, governance, and engineering practice.

## Benchmarks and Evaluation

Benchmarks are useful, but they often hide scaffold sensitivity, weak tests, contamination, or workflow mismatch.

### Core coding-agent benchmarks

- [SWE-bench: Can Language Models Resolve Real-World GitHub Issues?](https://openreview.net/forum?id=VTF8yNQM66)
  The benchmark that made repository-level issue resolution the center of coding-agent evaluation.
- [SWE-agent: Agent-Computer Interfaces Enable Automated Software Engineering](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/5a7c947568c1b1328ccc5230172e1e7c-Abstract-Conference.html)
  A landmark paper showing how interface and scaffold design can materially change real-world software task performance.
- [Introducing SWE-bench Verified](https://openai.com/index/introducing-swe-bench-verified/)
  Important for understanding why benchmark curation, underspecification, and flawed tests matter so much.
- [Why SWE-bench Verified No Longer Measures Frontier Coding Capabilities](https://openai.com/index/why-we-no-longer-evaluate-swe-bench-verified/)
  A strong warning that benchmark saturation and evaluation contamination can distort frontier conclusions.
- [SWE-rebench: An Automated Pipeline for Task Collection and Decontaminated Evaluation of Software Engineering Agents](https://openreview.net/forum?id=nMpJoVmRy1)
  Useful for readers interested in fresher, more automated, and more contamination-aware benchmark construction.
- [BigCodeBench: Benchmarking Code Generation with Diverse Function Calls and Complex Instructions](https://openreview.net/forum?id=YrycTjllL0)
  Expands the evaluation picture beyond narrow toy tasks toward more tool-rich programming scenarios.
- [MLE-bench: Evaluating Machine Learning Agents on Machine Learning Engineering](https://openai.com/index/mle-bench/)
  Extends the agent benchmark conversation into ML engineering, where setup and workflow complexity are first-class constraints.

### Evaluation questions worth keeping in mind

- How realistic is the task setup?
- How much does the result depend on the harness or scaffold?
- Are the tests trustworthy, stable, and contamination-resistant?
- Does the benchmark reflect issue-to-PR or CI-coupled work, or just isolated patching?
- Is environment setup part of the problem, or silently abstracted away?

## Harness and Repository-Aware Design

This section covers the substrate that often matters as much as the model itself: retrieval, repo maps, execution setup, monitors, and long-running harness design.

- [RepoCoder: Repository-Level Code Completion Through Iterative Retrieval and Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.151/)
  An early and influential paper showing how retrieval quality can dominate repository-scale code assistance.
- [Repoformer: Selective Retrieval for Repository-Level Code Completion](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/wu24a.html)
  A strong reference for selective context construction instead of naïvely stuffing more repository text into the prompt.
- [Repo2Run: Automated Building Executable Environment for Code Repository at Scale](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fZsd3KLMje)
  Especially valuable if you care about the often ignored bottleneck of reconstructing runnable environments.
- [Monitor-Guided Decoding of Code LMs with Static Analysis of Repository Context](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/662b1774ba8845fc1fa3d1fc0177ceeb-Abstract-Conference.html)
  Shows how static analysis and monitoring can improve repository-aware generation beyond plain prompting alone.
- [Harness Engineering: Leveraging Codex in an Agent-First World](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/)
  A practical systems note on why harness quality, evaluation loops, and task design now matter as much as model choice.
- [Harness Design for Long-Running Application Development](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps)
  A useful engineering perspective on long-running coding tasks, resets, verification, and operational agent reliability.

## Workflow-Native Products and Systems

The product shift is no longer just about generating code. It is about where agents live, what they can touch, and how they participate in software delivery workflows.
